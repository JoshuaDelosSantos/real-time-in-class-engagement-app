- Clarified project scope from `agent.md`, planned directory layout, and added README stubs to new folders.
- Built Docker base with FastAPI and Postgres, resolved image, dependency, and database naming issues, and documented the setup.
- Implemented FastAPI backend with health and database ping endpoints, added integration tests, and created a static frontend served via the API.
- Refactored into layered API/service/repository structure, introduced Pydantic schemas, and ensured tests pass after the restructuring.
