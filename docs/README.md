# Docs

Store extended documentation that complements `README.md` and `agent.md`.

Suggested contents include:
- Architecture decision records and design notes.
- Onboarding guides and operational runbooks.
- Meeting summaries and research findings.
- API references for frontend contributors [api](/docs/api/).

Organise subfolders as documentation grows.
