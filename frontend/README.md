# Frontend

This directory will host the web client for ClassEngage, starting with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

- `src/` will store components, views, and styling assets.
- `public/` will hold the HTML entry point and static resources.

Build tooling details will be added once the front-end stack is scaffolded.
